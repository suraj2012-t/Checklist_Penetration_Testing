- **Generate Reports**: Create on-demand summaries of completion stats, pending items, and critical missing tests.
- **Copy Payloads**: One-click copy for test payloads and commands.
- **Customizable**: Easily add or modify tests by editing the JSON data in `app.js`.
- **Easy Tracking**: Clean UI with progress bars, stats, and visual indicators for efficient workflow.
